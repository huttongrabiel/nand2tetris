TODO:
  - [X] Format .hack file output to have a new line after each instruction 
  - [X] Test .hack output against nand2tetris output
  - [X] Fix what doesn't work
  - [X] Find Another way to parse comp value that does not rely on the equal sign

Added fprintf(dotHack, "%c", '\n') to add new lines after each binary instruction.
Worked as expected. 

THE BUG CAME BACK TO BITE ME IN THE ASS. I have to rewrite the parser to not use the 
'=' when parsing comp instruction. If we don't have an equal sign (ie D;JGT) it fails. 
Back to the drawing board, hahaha. 

Bug Fix:
  Rewrote dest() and comp() to handle ok when there is not an '=' present. Just had to 
  check for the equal in the string first. Then handle differently depending on whether
  the equal was present or not. If equal was present then it used the equal sign. Otherwise
  the indexes and return values had to change a bit. Easy fix, only add like 10 lines of code.

Assembler now works on symbol-less programs. Now time to start working on symbolTable.c and get
the symbols to work. Have to use the predefined symbols and do a pass to collect the symbols
the programmer created.
