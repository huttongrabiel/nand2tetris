TODO:
  - work on fixing translateAInstruction()/translateCInstruction() bug
    - both functions work when called in translator.c however when i call them in assembler.c
      they output incorrect values. i have no idea why

translateAInstruction()/translateCInstruction() Bug
===================================================

- Both functions work as expected when fed inputs such as char *input = @2 or char *input = D=M+1;JGT
  (tested this in translator.c main() function)
- Both functions work if I pass trimLine() to parseA/CInstruction BUT ONLY WHEN IN TRANSLATOR.c
- If I pass these trimLine() to the parseA/CInstruction I get incorrect values
