# Assembler
Go into projects/06/ and look at assembler.c, translator.c, and parser.c to see
the C assembler I wrote for the hack language. It works on symbol-less programs
right now and I will be writing the symbol handling now. I wrote it in C which 
was really fun and led to a lot more learning. Plus my assembler is a lot faster
than it would be had I written it in python. 

# 00-06 Folders
Are all complete. Everything below 06 is hardware description language and bit of 
the hack asssembly language. Go check it out to see how I handle using logic gates
on virtual hardware. Pretty fun stuff.

# 07-13 Folders
These are Part II of the course which I have not gotten to yet. I will once
I finish Part I.
